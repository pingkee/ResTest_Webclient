        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. 
        You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. 
        You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. 
        The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Ping Kee.
        </p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        Ping Kee is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. 
        For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. 
        We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
        The Res Test app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. 
        It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, 
        which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. 
        It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and 
        it could mean that the Res Test app won’t work properly or at all.<br/><br/>

        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            You should be aware that there are certain things that Ping Kee will not take responsibility for. 
            Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, 
            but Ping Kee cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left. 
            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. 
            As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. 
        </p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) 
            without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission 
            from the bill payer for using the app. 
        </p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Along the same lines, Ping Kee cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery 
            and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Ping Kee cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            With respect to Ping Kee’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is 
            updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide data and information to us so that we can make it available to you. Ping Kee accepts no liability for any loss, 
            direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <h3>Content Contributed to the Site by Users</h3>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            With respect to Ping Kee’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is 
            updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide data and information to us so that we can make it available to you. Ping Kee accepts no liability for any loss, 
            direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.<br/><br/>

            The App allows users to create their own questions by assembling Content as questions and answer available on the App, and to share those questions through the App with other users. 
            The App also allows Ping Kee to review all submission of content before displaying in the app for our and our users reference in connection with the Service. 
            In this Agreement we refer to all of this Content, Questions or answers provided by users as “User Content”.<br/><br/>

            We do not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, but we do need the right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to provide the App and Services to users, 
            including to display your User Content in the manner requested by you to operate the App and Services. 
            In order for us to make the User Content you contribute available on the App for these purposes, and to operate, market and promote the Service, 
            we need the right to make use of such User Content in accordance with and subject to this Agreement. 
            For example, if you submit a question and/or answer, we need your license to display that User Content on the Services, 
            and we need the right to sublicense that User Content to our other users so that they can view that User Content.

            Therefore, by contributing User Content to the App or creating it on the App you automatically grant to us an irrevocable and perpetual (except as set forth in this Agreement), 
            non-exclusive, transferable, fully-paid, royalty-free (except as expressly set forth in this Agreement), worldwide license, by ourselves or with others, to use, copy, distribute, 
            publicly perform, publicly display, print, publish, republish, excerpt (in whole or in part), reformat, translate, modify, revise and incorporate into other works, 
            that User Content and any works derived from that User Content, in any form of media or expression, in the manner in which the Service from time to time permits User Content to be used, 
            in compliance with all applicable laws, and to license or permit others to do so. Our rights under this license remain in place even after termination of this Agreement or your account.<br/><br/>

            Our rights to “modify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from” are necessary because the normal operation of the Services does this to your User Content when it processes 
            it for use in the Services. This license also grants us the right to sublicense that User Content to other users to permit their use of that User Content in the manner in which the Service 
            from time to time permits User Content to be used. We may from time to time change the manner in which User Content can be used by the Service, and if we do so any license you have granted 
            to us under this Section shall automatically be extended to new uses permitted by the Service, and any our rights under licenses previously granted to us for uses no longer permitted by 
            the Service shall continue as described in this Section.<br/><br/>

            If you contribute User Content to the App, it is your responsibility to check the App from time to time to review how we permit User Content to be used. <br/><br/>

            You represent and warrant to Ping Kee that (a) you are the sole owner, author and copyright owner of User Content you contribute to the App or you have written permission from the author, 
            owner or copyright owner to make such User Content available to the Service as “User Content”, and (b) such User Content does not infringe upon any 
            third party rights (including but not limited to any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property rights, moral rights, privacy rights or publicity rights); 
            (c) such User Content complies with this Agreement and does not contain any defamatory, libelous or obscene material; (d) such User Content does not violate any applicable laws, 
            regulations, or contain any false statements or misrepresentations; and (e) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person, 
            or the owner/author of any objects or work in such User Content to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person, object or work, 
            to enable inclusion and use of such User Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement.<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h3>Indemnity</h3>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless to Ping Kee from any damage, liability, cost, expense, loss, claim or demand (collectively, “Losses”) including reasonable lawyers’ fees,

            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the 
            availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Ping Kee does not promise that it will always update the app 
            so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
